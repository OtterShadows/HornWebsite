  <h2>Jordan Gless</h2>
  <p><i>2013-2014 Marching Band Uniform Chair</i><br/>
  Class: 2016<br/>
  Hometown: Fort Collins, Colorado<br/>
  College: Agriculture and Life Sciences<br/>
  Major: Environmental Science And Sustainability</p>
  <p> Jordan "Mile High" Gless is a horn player from Colorado. Her nickname is both an homage to her mountainous home state and
  a reference to her affinity for high notes. She speaks Spanish, plays ukulele, and has two Mexican Red-rumped tarantulas
  named Pinta and Nina. Jordan is known for channelling her inner-dad with frequent obscure references and a flight of
  jokes/puns that are just plane terrible. Also, Jordan's horse Rocco is objectively the best thing on four legs;
  ask her about how the Jordan - Rocco story is mirrored in the movie How to Train Your Dragon.</p>

  <i>2014 Pep Band Historian</i><br/>
  Class: 2016<br/>
  Hometown: Oxford, MA<br/>
  College: Agriculture and Life Sciences<br/>
  Major: Animal Science</p>
  <p> She is a life long New Englander who loves cows, teaching, hockey, and music. Music is has always
  been an integral part of her life and that is why she joined the Big Red Bands after transferring to Cornell.
  Her love of cows and 4-H rivals her love for music and she was pretty much raised
  in a barn, working with cows. So ask her about cows! :D Even Russell Crowe knows what's up.</p>

  <h2>Ethan Burwell</h2>
  <p>
  Class: 2016<br/>
  Hometown: Kingston,NY<br/>
  College: Agriculture and Life Sciences<br/>
  Major: Atmospheric Science</p>
  <p> I prefer winter over summer. I like remote control cars. I prefer red over blue;  maroon to be specific.
  I haven't eaten meat since 2007. Crab-walking is cool.
  Well formed clouds are hot. I've never been skydiving, but I'd consider it.
  I've never been surfing, but I'd like to. I like to run. . . when I feel like it. Naps are golden. Pluto is a planet.</p>

  horn at the very first Pep Band rehearsal of her freshman year, and hasn't looked back! Emily also
  enjoys riding horses, exploring, and general frolicking shenanigans. </p>

	Class: 2014<br/>
	Hometown: Kingston, New York<br/>
	College: Agriculture and Life Sciences<br/>
	Major: Biology</p>
	<p>Jess is a curly blonde with a large nose.  She can often be seen wearing bright nail polish and an
	armful of macrame.  While not studying for biology (because let's be honest, she doesn't study that much),
	she can be found watching survivor or singing along to Taylor Swift.  She will also out-burp you anytime,
	anywhere.</p>

	Hometown: Valley Stream, New York<br/>
	College: Arts and Sciences<br/>
	Major: Science of Earth Systems (Planetary Science)</p>
	<p> Nicole Bardabelias really loves space. She has been playing French Horn for over
	10 years but has grown to love the mellophone. In her spare time, she enjoys hanging out with her fellow
	bandies and looking at Mars rocks with space robots. She would like to thank her HORN-y section buddies
	for picking her up off the street as a freshman and letting her join the only REAL horn section in the
	Ivy League! </p>

	Hometown: Buffalo, New York<br/>
	College: Agriculture and Life Sciences<br/>
	Major: Applied Economics and Management</p>
	<p>Peter is an AEM major and therefore never does any work.  Like Nicole, he played French Horn for years
	and had a hard time converting to mellophone.  He likes running, Jess's back massages, and can be found
	doing Tai-Chi on the top of Libe Slope as the sun rises.  Oh yeah... and don't be afraid to ask him about
	his big idea.</p>

	<p>Alex is an alum of the school of engineering. When she isn't parading across campus in an
	incredibly sexy marching band uniform, she might be found hiking, surfing, listening to Paul
	Simon, working on a project team aiming to build a preschool in South Africa this summer, or
	daydreaming about her favorite animal (try to guess what it is - shouldn't take you longer than
	5 minutes of talking to her). She likes fast cars, tight jeans, bubble baths, burritos, and long
	sunset walks on the beach.</p>

	<h2>Sam Dean</h2>

	Class: 2012<br/>
	Hometown: Gambrills, Maryland<br/>
	College: Agriculture and Life Sciences<br/>
	Major: Natural Resources</p>
	<p>Sam is the Ivy League product of functionally-dysfunctional domesticated rednecks.
	She was in guard for six years and started playing horn her freshman spring at Cornell.
	When she wasn't at band, she could be found in Eco House or on the third floor of #ClubMann
	writing her Daily Sun opinion column, Casual Wtfery. She's an expert in tree hugging and
	critters, and a burgeoning herpetologist. Her loves include Facebook stalking, mispronouncing
	words, live tweeting everything, telling bad stories, and obviously, the Big Red Bands. She's
	prone to gigglesnort fits and has a decidedly warped sense of what is appropriate in public.
	Somehow, someway, she acquired a reputation for trolling her friends (Maybe it was paying
	the treasurer entirely in coins? Was it that embarrassing Christmas card of the pep band
	manager? Maybe). Either way, you've not lived until you've received some late night tweets from Sam.</p>

	<h2>Kevin Boyd</h2>
	<p><i>2008 Marching Band Historian</i><br/>
	Class: 2011<br/>
	Hometown: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania<br/>
	College: Engineering<br/>
	Major: Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering</p>
	<p>KEVIN BOYD was born on the stroke of midnight during a tornado in a spacious castle north of Edinburgh. Several less miraculous things also occurred that night, including three-inch hail with smelt frozen in the middle, the alignment of Mars with the star Thuban, and a brief reversal of gravity. He has played the mellophone since the dawn of time, with occasional breaks to sleep and to protect his lands from marauding bands of ninjas. </p>
	<p>In the fall of 2007, he was warned by a wizened old man (in fact, his future self in a clever disguise) that the security of the Earth's timeline depended upon his joining the Cornell University Big Red Horn section. Moved by the passion of this venerable specter, he immediately uprooted his castle and shipped it via helicopter convoy to the South Hill of Ithaca.</p>
	<p>Upon landing, he devoted himself with all his monstrous tenacity to the task at hand and, after single-handedly liberating the Cornell dining halls from the clutches of a six-fingered man, laid his horn and at the feet of Sir Brian "Walrusball" Adelman and pledged fealty to the Big Red Pep Band.</p>
