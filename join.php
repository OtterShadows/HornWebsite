		<h2>Join Us!</h2>
		<p>Starting to get a feel for our section? Think it sounds kind of fun? Play horn (or feel like
		switching to a superior instrument)? Well joining is easy! Shoot us an
		<a href="mailto:bs599@cornell.edu,mhk99@cornell.edu">email</a> any time and we can give you more
		information. Or, come by the band room during Orientation Week (check your Orientation guide for
		days and times for easy "auditions") so we can get to know you, and, if you haven't sufficiently
		stalked us by then, you can get to know all of us as well! </p>

<p>Sound like too big of a time commitment? Don't fret. Since the Big Red Marching Band is a student
run organization, nothing is ever mandatory. Our philosophy is that we go to whatever we have time for
in between classes and other activities (but usually find this is as much as possible since we just can't
stay away).</p>

<p>Marching Band Rehearsal Schedule:<br/>
Tuesday 9pm - 11pm<br/>
Thursday 9pm - 10:15pm<br/>
Friday 4:45pm - 6pm</p>

<p>Home football games: Saturdays, report time ~9am.<br/>
Away football games: Leave on Friday afternoons, return on Saturday nights.
Check the Links section for the athletic calendar.</p>

<h2>Marching Band not your thing? (Or... just can't get enough band?)</h2>

<p>Join the Big Red Pep Band! We only practice one day a week (Mondays, 4:45pm - 6pm). We play at HOCKEY, basketball,
	lacrosse, and the occasional sprint football, wrestling match, or track meet. Same great people, same great
	fun, but with a slightly different atmosphere. Ask
	<a href="mailto:bs599@cornell.edu">Brandon Smith</a> or <a href="mailto:mhk99@cornell.edu">Maria Komorowski</a>,
	our current section leaders, for more information if you're interested!</p>
