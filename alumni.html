        <bio>Sam did six years of competitive color guard, and started playing horn her freshman spring at Cornell. When she wasn't at band, she could be found in Eco House or on the third floor of #ClubMann writing her Daily Sun opinion column, Casual Wtfery.
        <br><br>Somehow, someway, she acquired a reputation for mischievousness. <br>Maybe it was paying the treasurer entirely in coins? <br>
        Was it that smiley face she doodled on a photo of the drum major's butt? <br>
        The surprise Furby she mailed the tubas? Unclear.<br> Even as an alum, she continues to send annual holiday (trolliday?) cards to all her band friends.<br><br>

        A wildlife biologist and turtle expert by training, her arsenal of weird animal facts is unparalleled. In her OLDness, she now coordinates college science labs and teaches biology and human anatomy. You should know she's not like those other professors, she's a ~cool~ professor.  </bio>

        <h2>KR spent most of her childhood being brainwashed into Joining Band (TM) - her parents, also BRMB alumni, raised her on a steady diet of stories from their glory days. When she came to Cornell she was a little hesitant to join such a loud, eccentric, and stupidly friendly group of people, but she went to auditions ... and the rest is history!!</h2>
        <bio>KR initially joined the band as a flute/piccolo but she was quickly recruited by Lil Em '16 to learn to play the horn. From then on, she split her time between the flute section and the horn section, and she never looked back! Like many other bandies, she fell in love with the band and spent countless hours at Schoellkopf and Lynah. With the massive amount of time left in her schedule, she honed her fly-counting skills and earned a B.S. in Biological Sciences with a concentration in Genetics, Genomics, and Development. <br>KR now lives in Pittsburgh where she is pursuing a Doctor of Physical Therapy degree from Chatham University. She treasures all of her memories from those good old days on the hill, and her times with the band will always hold a very special place in her heart!</bio>
